# Machine Learning-Guided Selection of Cyclization Sites in Head-to-Tail Cyclic Peptides
code for training and applying ML model to predict cyclization sites in head-to-tail cyclic peptides 

## Files

`Model training.ipynb` : iPython notebook for training

`Prediction.ipynb`: iPython notebook for predicting unknown sequences

`model_307.pkl`:  best trained model for predicting 

`scaler307.pkl`:  unified normalization method 

`Cyclic peptides disconnection sequences generated.ipynb`:  iPython notebook for generation of sequences by disconnecting each cyclization site of the cyclic peptides

`Random Cyclopeptide Generator`:  iPython notebook for randomly generation cyclic peptide sequences for experimental validation

## CSV Files

`dataset.csv` : 306 peptide dataset for training

`experiment.csv`: 43 sequences for experimental validation

`targets.csv`: dataset of cyclic peptide sequences designed based on the antibody complementarity-determining regions corresponding to 7 disease targets

`processed_sequences.csv`: linear peptide sequences generated by disconnecting all cyclization sites of the cyclic peptides designed for the 7 disease targets using the `Cyclic peptides disconnection sequences generated` .

## Install the required packages
```bash
conda create -n cyclopeptide python==3.7.1
conda activate cyclopeptide
conda install numpy==1.21.5
conda install pandas==1.3.5
conda install scikit-learn==1.0.2
conda install tensorflow==2.8.2
conda install xgboost==1.5.1
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --name cyclopeptide
```
You can also use `pip install`, if `conda install` fails, try using `pip install`). If using `pip install`, make sure to install `joblib==1.1.1`. If a different version is installed, it needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled.

# Usage

To run the ML model, navigate to the Anaconda interface and execute the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Model training.ipynb`). Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to perform the analysis.(Switch the kernel to `cyclopeptide` in the installation guide)
